<h1>Overview of the Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java</h1>
<p>
  The Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java is a set of libraries and tools designed to make it easier for you to build solutions leveraging Amazon Mechanical Turk.  The goals of the SDK are:
  <ul>
    <li>To abstract you from the "muck" of using web services</li>
    <li>To simplify using the various Amazon Mechanical Turk APIs</li>
    <li>To allow you to focus more on solving the business problem and less on managing technical details</li>
  </ul>
</p>

Before getting started, you should first review the getting started and developer guides for the Amazon Mechanical Turk web service APIs <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=671&categoryID=28">here</a>.  They provide excellent background information on the various concepts of Amazon Mechanical Turk.

<h2>Portability of convenience files</h2>
In general, the convenience files (i.e. mturk.properties, input files, question template, HIT template, etc.) used by the Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for Java are portable to the Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line Tools.<p/>
However, the convenience files are not currently portable to other Amazon Mechanical Turk SDKs in other programming languages (i.e. Ruby, C#, PERL, etc.).<p/>
Portability across SDKs on different programming platforms is a desired goal for future releases.
